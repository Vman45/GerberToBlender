# GerberToBlender
A plugin for Blender 3D modeling software which (when completed) will import SVG exports of a Gerber file into an accurate virtual model of the PCB

Still a lot to do on this project, but so far it reads in a list of SVG files and sets up the x and y positions and sizes for each layer of the PCB. So basically only step one is completed so far, but eventually it will produce two versions of a completed model, one as a single piece and one separated into components.
